# heightmap
A 3d height field based on the data from image using shader-based OpenGL

This project is the first assignment of my Computer Graphics course. It is established on Windows platform using Visual Studio 2019. The project files are in ./hw1.

In this project, the main purpose is to create a three dimensional height field based on the data from 2D image. 
Mode 1: point
Mode 2: wireframe
Mode 3: solid triangles
Mode 4: smooth
Four different modes can be chosen by pressing key "1", "2", "3" or "4" correspondingly. 

The following is an exmaple.
